            COLONEL SANDER’S STORY
        </h3>
        <span class=" mr-4 p-4">
            From Young Cook to KFC’s Famous Colonel

            Kentucky Fried Chicken, pioneered by Colonel Harland Sanders, has grown to become one of the largest
            quick service food service systems in the world - with currently more than a billion "finger lickin'
            good" Kentucky Fried Chicken dinners served annually in more than 100 countries and territories. But
            success didn't come easily. <br> <br>

            In 1896 Harland's father died, forcing his mother to enter the workforce to support the family. At the
            tender age of six, young Harlan was responsible for taking care of his younger siblings and doing much
            of the family's cooking. A year later he was already a master of several regional dishes. Over the
            course of the next 30 years, Sanders held jobs ranging from streetcar conductor to insurance salesman,
            but throughout it all his skill as a cook remained.

            The Cook Becomes a Colonel
            <br> <br>
            In 1930, the then 40-year-old Sanders was operating a service station in Corbin, Kentucky, and it was
            there that he began cooking for hungry travelers who stopped in for gas. He didn't have a restaurant
            yet, so patrons ate from his own dining table in the station's humble living quarters. It was then that
            he invented what's called "home meal replacement" - selling complete meals to busy, time-strapped
            families. He called it, "Sunday Dinner, Seven Days a Week."
            <br> <br>
            As Sanders' fame grew, Governor Ruby Laffoon made him a Kentucky Colonel in 1935 in recognition of his
            contributions to the state's cuisine. Within four years, his establishment was listed in Duncan Hines'
            "Adventures in Good Eating."
            <br> <br>
            As more people started coming strictly for the food, he moved across the street to increase his
            capacity. Over the next decade, he perfected his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices and the basic
            cooking technique that is still used today.
            <br><br>
            The Colonel’s Cooking Spreads Worldwide
            <br>
            In 1955, confident of the quality of his fried chicken, the Colonel devoted himself to developing his
            chicken franchising business. Less than 10 years later, Sanders had more than 600 KFC franchises in the
            U.S. and Canada, and in 1964 he sold his interest in the U.S. company for $2 million to a group of
            investors including John Y. Brown Jr. (who later became governor of Kentucky).
            <br><br>
            Under the new owners, Kentucky Fried Chicken Corporation grew rapidly. It went public in 1966, was
            listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1969 and eventually was acquired by PepsiCo, Inc. in 1986. In
            1997, PepsiCo, Inc. spun-off of its quick service restaurants- including KFC-into an independent
            restaurant company, Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. Today, the restaurant company (now YUM! Brands,
            Inc.), is the world's largest in terms of system units with nearly 35,000 in more than 100 countries and
            territories.
            <br><br>
            Until he was fatally stricken with leukemia in 1980 at the age of 90, the Colonel traveled 250,000 miles
            a year visiting KFC restaurants around the world.
